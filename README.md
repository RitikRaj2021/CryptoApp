# CryptoApp

You are working for a small app development company called SurfsApp Limited. You've been tasked to create a mobile application that tracks up-to-date prices for crypto currencies. 

After successful completion and testing the company will publish this app to the Play Store.

The app should have the following features:

Have a list of at least 5 crypto currencies.
Refresh button that updates the prices via API
Integrate with the REST API of CoinAPI
Each crypto currency should have at least the following fields.
Name
Shorthand
Price
Icon (pulled from the API)
Optional features:

Let users add and remove their own crypto currencies from the list using the shorthand.
Let users add the amount of coins they have for each currency and shot the total value of their coins.
â€‹You have to create the design from scratch, develop and deploy and alpha version of the app for Android using Xamarin Forms.

You are allowed to choose your own colour scheme for the application.
